This project demonstrates my learning journey with **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, **PostgreSQL**, **JPA**, and other related frameworks. Below is a summary of the key technologies and frameworks used.

## Technologies and Frameworks Covered

### 1. **Spring Boot**
Spring Boot is the foundation of this project. It simplifies the setup and configuration of a Spring-based application and integrates various libraries to reduce boilerplate code. The `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency enables me to create RESTful APIs, while `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` helps me integrate JPA for database operations seamlessly.

### 2. **Spring Security**
Security is a crucial aspect of any application, and I integrated **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization purposes. With `spring-boot-starter-security`, I initially set up in-memory authentication and later implemented **DAO-based authentication** by using a custom `UserDetailsService` to load user data from the PostgreSQL database. This provides a robust and flexible authentication solution for both development and production environments.

### 3. **PostgreSQL**
For database management, I used **PostgreSQL**, an open-source relational database management system, to store user data, roles, and related entities. The `org.postgresql:postgresql` dependency enables seamless integration between Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. JPA (Java Persistence API) manages the mapping of Java entities to database tables, which significantly simplifies database interaction.

### 4. **Spring Data JPA**
**Spring Data JPA** is a key part of the persistence layer in this project. With `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, I was able to integrate JPA for data persistence, using Hibernate as the underlying ORM framework. This allowed me to efficiently map Java objects to relational database tables and perform CRUD operations without writing boilerplate code.

### 5. **Spring Boot Validation**
For input validation, I leveraged **Spring Boot Validation** via the `spring-boot-starter-validation` dependency. This allowed me to use annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Min`, `@Max`, and `@Pattern` for validating user input, ensuring that only valid data is stored in the database.

### 6. **Maven Plugin for Spring Boot**
The `spring-boot-maven-plugin` is responsible for packaging and running the application. It simplifies the process of building an executable JAR file that can be run with a single command (`mvn spring-boot:run`). This plugin is essential for deploying the application locally or to a production environment.

## Summary

This project covers core concepts and techniques in Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, PostgreSQL, and more. These technologies are essential for building full-stack Java applications with secure authentication, database integration, and API development. By following these tutorials, I learned how to:

- Set up Spring Boot and Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
- Integrate PostgreSQL as a relational database.
- Use JPA and Spring Data JPA to interact with the database.
- Implement input validation and exception handling in Spring Boot.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of these technologies and showcase my ability to apply them to real-world scenarios. You can explore the code to see how each concept was implemented.
